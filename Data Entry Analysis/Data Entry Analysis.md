#### This markdown document is related to the three files POND2010, ZOOP-TEMP, ZOOP-TEMP-MAIN

### PROJECT TITLE
#### Data Entry Analysis

### BELOW ARE THE THREE NEWLY ADDED FILES IN THE DIRECTORY
* [POND2010](https://github.com/pradeeppal07/Assignment-8086/blob/master/Data%20Entry%20Analysis/pond2010.xlsx),
* [ZOOP-TEMP](https://github.com/pradeeppal07/Assignment-8086/blob/master/Data%20Entry%20Analysis/zoop%20-%20temp.xlsx),
* [ZOOP-TEMP_MAIN](https://github.com/pradeeppal07/Assignment-8086/blob/master/Data%20Entry%20Analysis/zoop%20-%20temp-main.xlsx)

### Task 1 Problems Identification
#1: Based on class readings, prior experience, and your own good sense, list some of the problems in the way that the data are currently organized (there are at least 8 problems with these spreadsheets; try to identify as many as possible, but at least 4).

##### **Response:** 
The problems identified from the data files provided are as follows :-

1. Few data values in red and yellow color in both the zoop- temp xlsx and zoop -temp main xlsx files and  their is no reference or color code mentioned, like which color represent what. 
2. As mention in information that, investigators wanted to examine the day-night distribution of the zooplankton but the data collection only consists of the date but not specify the time when the data is collected. 
3. In the spreadsheet zoop temp.xlsx, it is stated that "_ Station B is in a shallower southern arm of the lake, see yellow notebook for map and details _" but there is no source or link related to yellow notebook is provided for reference.
4. In the spreadsheet of pond2010.xlsx , data is for the year 2010, whereas the zoop temp data and zoop temp-main files is having data for the year 2011. So its  would be quite difficult to linking all these data files and converting them for useful information.
5. The units of measurement for the columns in all the data files are missing.
6. Most of the column names are abbreviated and there is no definitions stated clearly anywhere for all the column names. So its is very difficult for investigator or any person to viewed data through column names.
7. In both zoop temp.xlsx and  zoop temp main.xlsx, I found there was a negative value in column names Chippo#/L and Cuni#/L respecively. which seems to be irrelevant and found no connection with any parameter.


### Task 2 Solutions
#2: Suggest a new system for organization. Create a table in your Markdown document showing a potential template for later years of data collection that would address the problems you identified in #1.
##### **Response**:

Few point, I would like to recommend

1. All the units of measurement should be mention along with column name, so that it will be easy for investigator to analysis the spreadsheet.
2. An additional column called "Time (EST)" can be added to analysis the data to meet the criteria of the day and night distribution. 
3. An additional column can be added with the column name as "Reference" for noting any other important information.
4. I believe there should be no negative value included in the data.
5. The column names should be written clearly or provide legend for the convenience of the investigator.
6. Having an additional column with the name "Miscellaneous information" as stated in point 2 can resolve this issue
7. Data set zoop-temp.xlsx and zoop-temp-main.xlsx files can be combined into one single excel sheet because there is no difference in column name and through this way we can reduce incompatibility.
