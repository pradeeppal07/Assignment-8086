---------------
Iam planing to set up a public [mailing list for discussion about markdown][ml]
Any topic related to Markdown -- both its formatting syntax and
its software -- is fair game for discussion. Anyone who is interested
is welcome to join.
> It's my hope that the mailing list will lead to good ideas for future
improvements to Markdown.
